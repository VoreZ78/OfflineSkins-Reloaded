# OfflineSkins-Reloaded-26.1-26.1.2

OfflineSkins Reloaded for Minecraft 26.1-26.1.2.

## Configuration

OfflineSkins Reloaded provides a YACL-based configuration menu.

The configuration can be opened through:

- The button in the Minecraft Title Screen
- The button in the Pause Screen
- The `U` key
- `/offlineskins menu`

## HD Textures

OfflineSkins Reloaded supports high-resolution skins and capes.

HD textures can be enabled through the `allowHD` setting for supported servers.

When HD textures are not allowed for players on a server, the mod can replace oversized skins and capes with special fallback textures:

- `SkinHDNotAllowed.png`
- `CapeHDNotAllowed.png`

This helps optimize network traffic from players using high-resolution skins or capes when HD textures are not permitted.

The local cached texture system can still contain textures of arbitrary supported resolutions.

## Cached Textures

The mod uses the local cache directory:

## Custom Server Skin and Cape Providers

The mod also supports custom skin and cape providers, allowing skins and capes from external servers to be loaded into your game.

## ⚠️ Content Warning

OfflineSkins Reloaded may load skins and capes from third-party services.
Third-party services may contain user-created content that can be provocative, offensive, disturbing or otherwise inappropriate. This content is not controlled, moderated or endorsed by the OfflineSkins Reloaded project.
Use third-party skin and cape sources at your own discretion.
